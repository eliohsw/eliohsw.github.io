<div class="about-content">
  <p>
    Hi, I’m Elio, an Electrical Engineering undergraduate at National Taiwan University from Taipei, Taiwan.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am a person who enjoys diving into new subjects and stepping outside my comfort zone, whether that means learning a new theory, picking up a new tool, or exploring an unfamiliar domain.
  </p>
  <p>
    Academically, I’m most interested in how information can be represented, transmitted, and protected, especially under noise, uncertainty, or adversarial settings. That curiosity draws me to coding theory, communication systems, cryptography, and AI/ML, with a foundation in combinatorics, probability theory, and number theory. I’m excited by applications where rigorousness matters, such as reliable risk assessment and risk-aware decision-making, as well as building AI systems that are robust, trustworthy, and based on real-world limitations.
  </p>
  <p>
    I’ve worked on both academic and practical projects across a range of areas, including open-source template development, physical and probabilistic modeling, data analysis, graphic design, and event organization and coordination. I enjoy balancing focused, detail-oriented work with collaborative work that aligns goals, scope, and constraints.
  </p>
  <p>
    In projects, I like bringing structure to messy questions and keeping everyone aligned. I often start by illustrating the main goal and success criteria, then filter restrictions and assumptions before turning the problem into something concrete and testable. It is important for me to emphasize clear communication with collaborators, prioritize efficiency, and tackle challenges directly. There has been significant success following this approach with fellow students and partners, but I’m always looking to further improve it.
  </p>
  <p>
    Outside of academics, I’m passionate about language learning, linguistics, and reading across a variety of genres. I speak fluent English and Mandarin, and I have some experience with German and Dutch. For fun, I play badminton and chess, and I’m a geography enthusiast (including GeoGuessr). I also enjoy international cultural exchange through traveling and volunteering. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Currently, I’m working on research with Prof. Hsin-Po Wang and planning an exchange as well as exploring internship opportunities overseas. Looking forward, I am committed to expanding my academic and professional horizons, and I am eager to make meaningful contributions to future collaborative and interdisciplinary endeavors.
